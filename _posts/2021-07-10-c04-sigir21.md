# TLDR

<ul>
  <li> Identifying author's emotions from written narratives is a challenging task. </li>
  <li> Psychological Theories of Emotion - <i> Categorical </i> (cognitively simpler) Vs <i> Dimensional </i> (fundamentally stronger) </li>
  <li> We propose a solution that exploits the strong correlation between the two models of emotion representation to efficiently detect emotions from tweets. </li>
</ul>

# Overview

Human emotions are characterized by how we react to various events. They play a central role in our understanding and descriptions of the world around us. Detecting emotions from short texts, especially tweets, is a crucial task
given its widespread applications in e-commerce, public health monitoring, stock market analysis, disaster management, etc. Understanding the nuances and complexities of human emotions is challenging and has therefore given rise to one of the most pressing debates among researchers on how best to represent emotions. Traditionally, the field of psychology has been dominated by two <i> seemingly opposing </i> theories of emotion, with their own set of supporters: a <i> Categorical </i> theory and a <i> Dimensional <i> theory.

## Categorical Theory

Categorical models of emotion representation classify affective states into discrete categories. In 1992, for instance, Paul Ekman proposed the existence of <b> six </b> basic, distinct, and universal emotions: happiness, anger, sadness, surprise, disgust, and fear. In 1980, psychologist Robert Plutchik created the <i> Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions </i> that provides a great framework for understanding an emotion and its purpose. The wheel is divided into <b> eight </b> sectors corresponding to eight primary emotions: joy, trust, fear, surprise, sadness, anticipation, anger, and disgust. Each primary emotion has a polar opposite based on the physiological reaction it creates. Further, emotions intensify as they move from the outside to the center of the wheel, which is also indicated by the color: the darker the shade, the more intense the emotion.

Humans can however perceive hundreds of different emotions. While the categorical models are cognitively more suitable to work with, they have a limited scope. Also, it is almost infeasible to create datasets annotated for the presence/absence of hundreds of different emotions. <i> How can we capture a broader range of affective states? </i>

# Summary

We show that the performance of emotion recognition in written narratives, especially tweets, can be improved by utilizing the better representational power of the dimensional models of emotion representation.
