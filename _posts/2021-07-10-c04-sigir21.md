# TLDR

<ul>
  <li> Identifying author's emotions from written narratives is a challenging task. </li>
  <li> Psychological Models of Emotion Representation - Categorical (cognitively simpler) Vs Dimensional (fundamentally stronger)</li>
  <li> We propose <b> <i> VADEC </i> </b>, a multi-task model that utilizes the better representational power of the dimensional theory to improve the multi-label emotion classification performance </li>
</ul>

# Overview

Human emotions are characterized by how we react to various kinds of events. They play a central role in our understanding and descriptions of the world around us. In this work, we focus on building an efficient solution for automatically detecting emotions from written narratives, especially tweets. While the nuances and complexities of human emotions make our job difficult, itâ€™s an extremely crucial task given its widespread applications. We show that the performance of emotion recognition in
written narratives, especially tweets, can be improved by
utilizing the better representational power of the dimensional models of emotion representation.
