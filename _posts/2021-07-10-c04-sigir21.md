# TLDR

<ul>
  <li> Identifying author's emotions from written narratives is a challenging task. </li>
  <li> Psychological Theories of Emotion - <i> Categorical </i> (cognitively simpler) Vs <i> Dimensional </i> (fundamentally stronger) </li>
  <li> We propose a solution that exploits the strong correlation between the two models of emotion representation to efficiently detect emotions from tweets. </li>
</ul>

# Overview

Human emotions are characterized by how we react to various events. They play a central role in our understanding and descriptions of the world around us. Detecting emotions from short written narratives, especially tweets, is a crucial task
given its widespread applications in e-commerce, public health monitoring, stock market analysis, disaster management, etc. Understanding the nuances and complexities of human emotions is challenging and has therefore given rise to one of the most pressing debates among researchers on how best to represent emotions. Traditionally, psychology has been dominated by two <i> seemingly opposing </i> theories of emotion, with their own set of supporters and followers: a <i> Categorical </i> theory and a <i> dimensional <i> theory.

# Summary

We show that the performance of emotion recognition in written narratives, especially tweets, can be improved by utilizing the better representational power of the dimensional models of emotion representation.
