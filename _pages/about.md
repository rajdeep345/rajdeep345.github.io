Welcome! I am a fourth-year Ph.D. Candidate at the Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kharagpur advised by [Prof. Pawan Goyal](http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~pawang/) and [Prof. Sourangshu Bhattacharya](http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~sourangshu/). As part of the Complex Networks Research Group ([CNeRG](https://cnerg-iitkgp.github.io/)), I work on problems that lie at the intersection of Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval, and Computational Social Science. In 2018, I interned at IBM Research, India with [Dipyaman Banerjee](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=zFoDxz8AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Kuntal Dey](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IlC2GRUAAAAJ&hl=en).

I obtained my Masters from IIIT Delhi under the supervision of [Prof. Sambuddho Chakravarty](https://sites.google.com/site/sambuddhochakravarty/home?authuser=0). I did my Undergrad at Jadavpur University, where I worked with [Prof. Samiran Chattopadhyay](http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/profile.php?uid=615). Additionally, I have four years of professional experience with [PwC India](https://www.pwc.in/) specializing in Data Modeling and Business Intelligence.
