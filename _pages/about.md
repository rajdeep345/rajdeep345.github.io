As part of the Complex Networks Research Group ([CNeRG](https://cnerg-iitkgp.github.io/)), I work on problems that lie at the intersection of Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval, and Computational Social Science.

I obtained my Masters from IIIT Delhi under the supervision of [Prof. Sambuddho Chakravarty](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/sambuddho). I did my Undergrad at Jadavpur University, where I worked with [Prof. Samiran Chattopadhyay](http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/profile.php?uid=615).
